    <h1 >How to Play</h1>
    <p id="S">Basketball is a team sport. Commonly with 5 players on a team. On a rectangular cout. The goal is to score 
        on the opponent basket. while preventing the opposite team to score on your basket.  
        A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. 
        After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one,
        two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins,
        but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
    </p>
    <p id="S">Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) 
        or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, 
        players may use a variety of shots â€“ the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, 
        they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense 
        or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard.
        It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it,
        or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.</p>
